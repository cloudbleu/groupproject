      <p> Filmed on a barren soundstage in Sweden, and set in Colorado, Dogville tells the story of Grace Mulligan, a woman who is hiding from mobsters. The people of the small town of Dogville, Colorado provide refuge for Grace in exchange for physical labor when she needs to hide from mobsters. Grace must win over the towns people in order to make the refuge "worth their while". We soon find out that not is all as it seems and the two-faced town increase their demands on Grace, and start to resent her helpless outsider position. Directed by Lars Von Trier, starring  Nicole Kidman, Chloë Sevigny, Paul Bettany, Stellan Skarsgård. </p>

    	<p> Code Girls Review</p>
    	<p> The Dogme 95 Manifesto started by the Danish directors Lars Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg  set about making film an art form again. The manifesto stated several rules for filmmaking, one of which included not using special effects or technology. These rules can be seen in Lars Von Trier's Dogville. Filmed on a minimalist set, with no walls between the houses on set, it can be argued that Dogville is a work of out. The film is full of unexpected twists and turns, and it will keep the viewers attention until the climatic final scene. </p>
